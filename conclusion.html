		<h1>Conclusion</h1>
	</header>
	<p>Fines are ineffective in the faces of those whose wallets never run out of money. It’s a waste of time to
		continuously
		pursue Big Tech in courtrooms with demands for money when they would happily give it up if it meant they get to
		remain
		greedy. Tech Giants need a new means of punishment. They require structural remedies that don’t punish them but
		force
		them into the confines of the law. These structural remedies create a fair and competitive market that the
		Antitrust
		laws dreamed of establishing. They are more time-consuming to make and hand out, though, due to their
		personality; they
		actively target each company as opposed to a one-size-fits-all approach.</p> <div class="conclude"><p><strong><i>However, it would prove most beneficial
		to
		impose structural remedies more frequently so that everyone can finally reside on the same playing field as the
		cheaters
		who have cheated since the first markings of technology.</i></strong></p>
