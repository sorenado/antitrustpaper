		<h1>The Opposition</h1>
	</header>
    <p><i> While critics insist that Tech Giants defend against the fines, revealing that tech corporations care
	about the
	penalties imposed on them and thus proving that these fines still hold merit,</i></p>
  
    <div class="rebuttal-container"><p><strong><i>they fail to realize that Tech
	Giants
	still want to cut as many costs as possible.</i></strong></p></div>
		<h2>The Counter</h2>
    <p class="counter-paragraph"> Yes, Apple, during its prosecution by the Department of
			Justice, claimed
			that the DOJ was “‘wrong on the facts and law’” and sought to “‘vigorously defend against” the lawsuit
			(Associated
			Press). As mentioned before, these lawsuits typically go for millions of dollars, and although that amount
			is minute in
			the grand scheme of the business, they’d still like to keep that money. As a trillion-dollar tech
			corporation, losing
			$30 million won’t break the bank; however, those millions could have increased their profit margins through
			investments.
			These Tech Giants also have to pay large amounts of workers and keep the lights on, which can be costly when
			operating
			at such a massive scale globally. Not to mention that these fines are often recurring due to the wealthy
			tech
			corporations’ repeated infractions. The sums add up. Hence, they seek to battle it out in the courtrooms.
			But this is
			not to deter them. As mentioned, the fines fail to change, not punish, the corporations and stop them from
			committing
			such acts. Assembling a defense team against these trials for the Tech Giants might cost them, but it’s
			nothing compared
			to what they might pay when they have to change. That’s why they are more willing to fight the expensive
			legal battles
			handed to them left and right: because the latter, changing their structures and preventing them from
			performing
			anti-competitive actions, lowers the gap between the Tech Giants and the rest of the tech corporations, both
			financially
			and in market share.
