		<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Tech Giants, behemoths of the tech industry, find themselves in trouble with the government quite often.
				This results from their repeated infractions of United States Antitrust laws, laws that establish a
				business’s conduct
				and regulate its structure. This trouble with the government is often settled in courtrooms that demand
				fines from these
				corporations. However, their recurring violations denote their lack of regard for these suits.
				Therefore, questions have
				arisen regarding the way the US government handles corporations.</p>
		<h3>The Verdict</h3>
      <p>One of the points for discourse is whether or not fines are stopping these Giants from committing Antitrust.</p>
      <div class="verdict-container"><p><strong>Although
	still fought in the courtroom, fines imposed on Tech Giants do not do enough to deter them from breaking Antitrust laws
	due to their excessive amounts of money and the fines’ lack of structural change.</strong></p></div>
