		<h2>Introduction</h2>
    <div class="intro-p-one">
    <p>Tech Giants, behemoths of the tech industry, find themselves in trouble with the government and trouble quite often.
	This results from their repeated infractions of United States Antitrust laws, laws that establish a business’s conduct
	and regulate its structure. This trouble with the government is often settled in courtrooms that demand fines from these
	corporations. However, their recurring violations denote their lack of regard for these suits. Therefore, questions have
	arisen regarding the way the US government handles corporations.</p>
