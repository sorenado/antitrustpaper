  <h1>The Facts</h1>

<section class="finance">
  <h2>Reason 1: Their Wealth</h2>
  <p>Tech Giants are too wealthy for fines to impede them. Mega corporations of the tech industry, like Apple, often have an
“Everest of cash” that enables them to view even “massive fines” as a “bearable cost of doing business,” incentivizing
them to maintain their unlawful and anti-competitive methods of business at cheap expenses (Rosenberg). There is more
significant revenue to be made by continuing to break antitrust law and monopolize the tech industry than by quitting
because of a small dent in their funds. Monopolizing the tech industry limits the market's cash flow to only these
giants, increasing their market share and income, so there is a great incentive to continue these practices as
frequently and massively as possible. Not much money will deter these Tech Giants with an overflow of financial
resources. However, this insight doesn’t mean these fines lack financial merit in the eyes of most companies; the
Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) often sue these companies for violating antitrust
laws for millions of dollars. For many corporations, even a million dollars is the difference between staying afloat and
filing for bankruptcy.</p>

  <h2>Reason 2: Structural Remedies</h2>
  <p>Fines lack the means to change the integral operations and structures that cause Tech Giants to continue breaking
Antitrust laws. By employing “structural remedies,” rulings that force corporations to substantially “change how they do
business,” the government and the law can start to impose severe consequences and become a “real danger” to these Tech
Giants (Rosenberg). These rulings may force the company to sell its products to smaller corporations to inhibit its
market share in the tech world. That is how change happens: through grounded and targeted attacks on an issue. By
selling or breaking off their divisions, assets, and products, their structures for profit - the integral ways they make
money - dwindle. They have to quickly reassess how to make money and search for different means of doing so, all while
dealing with the costs of sustaining a business; even though these Tech Giants make a great deal of money, they also
spend a great deal covering costs, which would ascend to grievous financial burdens if they can no longer make those
excessive amounts of cash. Ironically, this would hurt the businesses far more than fines could. Whereas fines seek to
punish, structural remedies change the company, deterring them significantly from violating Antitrust laws. It is akin
to locking someone up for drug abuse vs. providing them with resources to quit the drug abuse; incarcerating people who
indulge in drugs may deter people from entertaining the thought of using substances. However, it wouldn’t address the
root issue. And that’s not something these capitalistic Tech Giants are eager to face. They are tuned in to watch the
Department of Justice’s prosecution of Google on account of Antitrust and how the DOJ will “crackdown” on “growth
tactics,” revealing heavy anxieties about how their operations might change (Nieva). The anxiety displayed amongst the
Tech Giants at this Antitrust suit indicates that they realize that money will be lost if the suit tilts in favor of the
smaller companies and the DOJ. It’s far more effective than the insistent yet ineffective fines thrown at them every
week, like they are a weekly expense. Yet it’s important to acknowledge why the US Government agencies still find
themselves suing Big Tech for the change in their wallets: it works to some extent.</p>
